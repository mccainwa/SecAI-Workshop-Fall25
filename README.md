# SecAI-Workshop-Fall25

Wellcome to SecureAI - Cybersecurity Training for AI

**SecureAI** is a cybersecurity and privacy training program designed for AI professionals and researchers to equip them with the knowledge and skills to build AI systems that are technically sound and secure. The program is a series of 6 engaging and hands-on synchronous online sessions/workshops held every two weeks for a period of one and half month. The sessions are held at evening times (**6:00 PM CDT**) to accommodate participants with busy work-day schedules. **SecureAI** follows an experiential training approach offered by experts in AI security, and each workshop includes practical lab activities.


## Workshops

Each workshop in the SecureAI program now combines **flexible self-paced learning** with **interactive live discussions**. Participants first engage with a **pre-recorded lecture** at their own pace, where leading AI security experts share their insights, knowledge, and real-world experiences. Alongside the lecture, participants complete practical lab activities to apply the concepts covered.

Once participants have reviewed the materials, they join a **live discussion session** with experts in the field. These sessions focus on answering questions, clarifying concepts, and exploring advanced applications.

**Live session time via Zoom**: 6:00â€“8:00 PM CDT

**Note**: To maximize the value of the live discussions, participants are encouraged to complete the lecture and lab activities before attending the session.
